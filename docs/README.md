# Package Documentation

This directory is a placeholder for project-specific documentation.

While this template does not include extensive documentation, you should use this space to document your project's architecture, design decisions, and user guides.

For now, you can find basic information in:

- [**`../README.md`**](../README.md): Project overview and setup.
- [**`../examples/`**](../examples/): Code examples.
- **Source Code Docstrings**: API-level documentation.
